<h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe" aria-hidden="true"></span> Scatter Demo</h1> 
<p>This is a reusable scatter plot produced with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.  The scatter plot allows you to compare, up-to, five variables; x, y, z, color and the size/radius. 
  The plot grammar should be fully responsive however it does not yet add/remove marks as the size gets large/small for them.  Here are some features of the chart:
  <ul>
    <li>a responsive, reusable d3 chart</li>
    <li>Zoom in/out on the x/y axis</li>
    <li>Change the x/y axis scale and dimension</li>
    <li>X vs. Y vs. Z vs. Color vs. Size</li>
    <li>Changeable aggregate function as well as the four quadrants</li>
    <li>Interactive z-dimension (hover over z-axis overlay)</li>
    <li>Object constancy on transitions</li>
  </ul>
