<p>This is an example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatter plot</a> built with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.  This 
version can compare up to five metrics (x vs. y vs. z vs. color vs. circle size).</p>
<p>The features of the chart must currently be disabled via css. The data set that is currently used is <a href="d3/nations">"nations"</a>.  This data set and the idea for the z-axis were borrowed from <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/">Mike Bostock</a>.</p>
